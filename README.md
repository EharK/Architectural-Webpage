# Architectural-Webpage

We have created a webpage for a company called Arhitektuurinurk OÜ. The webpage itself has a very simple layout with navigation tabs available on the navigation bar which sticks
to the top of the screen even while scrolling through the page. There are 3 tabs: Main page, gallery and contact. Gallery contains pictures of previous company projects and
contacts tab contains a section for sending an email from the webpage itself and a second section for contact information.
